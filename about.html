  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am Dualo, Dee Jay Domoguen, currently taking a Bachelor of Science in Criminology.
    I love taking pictures, drawing, motorcycle riding, hiking, and going to the gym in my free time.
    I graduated elementary at Ambagiw Elementary School, studied at Agawa National High School in my junior high,
    then took the STEM strand in my senior high school at St. James High School Of Mt. Province Inc.,
    where I gained experience working with BFP officers during our work immersion —
    learning Basic Life Support, knot tying, firefighting, and rappelling.
    I also participated in the BLS competition during the Ubaya Festival,
    where we were awarded Best in Knot Tying and Fastest Time to Finish the Course.
